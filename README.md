# tab-down

tabdown is an open-source browser extension that allows users to hide a tab and temporarily reveal it by moving their mouse to the top of the screen. The hidden tab drops down to display its contents over part of the screen and collapses when no longer needed.

The goal is to reduce tab switching and keep workflows cleaner, especially for tasks like research, note-taking, or messaging.

## Features (WIP)
- Hide a tab from view
- Reveal the hidden tab by dragging the cursor to the top of the screen
- Dropdown overlay covers part of the screen and collapses automatically

## Installation (Development)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ossd-s26/tab-down
   ```
